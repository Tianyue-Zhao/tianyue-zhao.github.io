    I am a masters student studying computer science. I have a solid
    CS/Math/ML background, and I plan to keep developing a career in
    computer science by doing what I do best - excelling in software
    engineering teams.
      However, it is also very exciting to join a promising new
    field and be a part of its long-term growth. Household robotics
    and bioprinting are my two key areas of interest. I have
    research experience that gives me a solid understanding of both,
    and am always looking for opportunities in these two fields.
