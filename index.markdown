    I am a software engineer with a solid background in CS/Math/ML,
    and I plan to keep developing a career in computer science by
    doing what I do best - excelling in software engineering teams.
    In the past four years, I had a lot of fun completing my
    undergrad and masters studies at UCSD, and I'm glad to say that
    I am now formally UCSD alumni :)
      Aside from just doing my job, network security and bioprinting
    are two areas that I'm very interested in, the former for its
    rapid development of fun new concepts, and the latter for the
    amount of impact it may have in the future. I'm always looking
    for opportunities in these two areas.
