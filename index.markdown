    I am currently an undergraduate at UC San Diego,
    specializing in machine learning algorithms. Recently
    that means I’m reading papers on and experimenting
    with adversarial training for neural networks and some
    of its very interesting side-effects. I also enjoy
    working on hardware projects at the makerspace.
    When I’m not doing these things, I might be on an
    afternoon hike somewhere waiting for sunset to come :)
