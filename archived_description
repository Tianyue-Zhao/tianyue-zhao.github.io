    I am currently an undergraduate at UC San Diego,
    specializing in mathematics and computer science.
    Recently that means I’m reading papers on and
    experimenting with adversarial training for neural
    networks and some of its very interesting
    side-effects. I also enjoy working on hardware
    projects at the makerspace. When I’m not doing
    these things, I might be on an afternoon hike
    somewhere waiting for sunset to come :)
